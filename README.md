# JavaToPythonCrossCompiler.
Project: Java cross-compiler/translator to Python.  

Create a compiler that translates Java code into Python code (and the Java can then be translated and run as a Python program).  

- Team researches and identifies the language specification for Java that will be translated into Python. 
- Input Java code is error free  (5 examples from simple to complex). 
- Begin with translating simple Java language constructs like assignments and FOR loops. 
- Need to be able to parse the input Java program, identifying language constructs and translating to their equivalent Python. 
- Also need to develop a set of progressively more complex Java program examples for translation. 
- UI MUST have two code panels, left is original, right is translated.  Left panel must allow loading a file, or editing in place.  UI must support saving either panel to a file.
